** Setup
Required software:
1. Eclipse
1. Soot
1. 
*** Soot 
The static analysis is based on the [[http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/soot/][Soot compiler framework]]. Here are
some quick setup instructions:
- Get Eclipse (Juno is fine)
- Go to http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/soot/soot_download.html, download soot-2.5.0, the complete package
- Unpack the archive somewhere (three directories, (soot, polyglot, jasmin) will be created)
- Download a binary distribution of [[http://ant.apache.org/bindownload.cgi][Apache Ant]].
- Follow instructions in =soot-2.5.0/soot_in_eclipse_howto.html=. 
- Install the [[http://www.sable.mcgill.ca/soot/eclipse/updates/index.html][Soot Eclipse plugin]]
- Now you should be able to import projects from this repository
  without soot-related compilation errors.
