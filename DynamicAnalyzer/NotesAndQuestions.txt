Originally, there were 91 runs (incl one that i wrote to test things out).
Note that ALL tests from analyszer.level2 work perfectly.
Out of these 91, exactly 19 failed. These 19 were ALL from the src.main.testclasses, run via classfiletests.ClassTest
 (which contains 27 tests).
 ---- why are there two folders of tests to begin with?!

RESOLVING:
- three (3) tests that threw "MethodNotImplemented Exceptions" could by fixed by deleting all files from sootOutput/main/testclasses:
	There were old, compiled versions that JUnit seemed to use if present. Now, only 16/91 tests fail.
- in tests.classfiletests.ClassTest, there is specified which tests from src.main.testclasses to run, and what their result should be.
	note that if i do smth stupid here, like say that a TestFail should not fail, we increase the number of failed runs (obviously)

ALSO: Some tests fail in JUnit, work in CMD, and work in JUnit again if the compiled TestFile.class is found under sootOutput/main/testclasses.

5__ MOST IMPORTANT! __
how can i debug a instrumented programm?!?! with eclipse, possible. even possible?

0__
tests failed because:
a) there were old compiled filed with invalid names in them
b) No Exception where there should be one: goes away if compiled class is in sootOutput
	-> but then, still the variables are wrong!
	-> if one sets involvedVars correctly, the test passes!


3___
how to convert several files at once

4__
what does run config: RunMainAnalyserJ/C do?!?!

2___
why, in folder /Users/NicolasM/Dropbox/hiwi/progLang/jgs/DynamicAnalyzer, when calling: 

java -cp soot-2.5.0.jar soot.Main -cp .:/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.7.0_79.jdk/Contents/Home/jre/lib/rt.jar src/main/testclasses/ArithmeticExpressionsFail.java

do i get: Exception in thread "main" java.lang.RuntimeException: Attempt to create RefType containing a / --> src/main/testclasses/ArithmeticExpressionsFail.java

1___
what is:
- assignment level
- security level
- local Program Counter
- global PC

it seems to me, that:

assignmentLevel 	localPc
	\				/
	 \			   /
	new level of local

correct? and assignment-level == security level?!


6__
if i change stuff in level2.Handler, it is live and running (eg logger changed), even when i run it from the
cmd. why?! how?

7__ rename ok? from addLevelOfLocal to joinLevelOfLocalAndAssignmentLevel
