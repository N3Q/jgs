TODOs:

* Removing the unwanted local variables in the Jimple output
	-> Restructuring the AnnotationValueSwitch into Left and Right,
	   may want to have a Super Class throwing only Exceptions,
	   Such that left Child then only implements the needed Methods.

* Restructuring the Logger, that it has 
	- more readable output.
	- structured usage.

* In general: Add (good) documentation!
