Week1:
- Introduction and getting to know the project 
- find out why JUnit Tests fail
- fixed a bug where end-to-end test passed because no compiled binary was present, and failed
	if an outdated binary was present

Week2:
- ClassCompile written: Compile end-to-end tests automatically before testrun
- Output folder now configurable
- Fixed bug that IllegalFlowExcpetion could be thrown, but no involved variable was given and test still passed
